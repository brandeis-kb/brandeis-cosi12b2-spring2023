### Topics
= Tenants of OOP
* Abstraction - abstract classes and interfaces
* Encapsulation - a class with private members and methods
* Inheritance - through implements (interface) or extends for class; code re-use; is-a relationship
* Polymorphism - ability for an object to be used as if it were a different type
  * implement multiple interfaces
  * method overloading
  * method overriding
 
* Overloading vs overriding
  * overload is a method name that is re-used, with different parameters
  * overriding is a subclass clobbering it's parents implementation
* Abstract Class - defines a class structure you want to use
  * can implement methods, and leave other unimplemented
  * can not be instantiated, must be subclassed to be used
* Collection - a bunch of stuff; zero or more "items" of the same type
* List and ArrayList
  * an indexed collection
* LinkedList
  * a collection that is not naturally indexed, but has faster insertion / deletion
  * a recursive data structure
* Stack
  * a collection with LIFO storage policy
* Queue
  * a collection with FIFO storage policy
* Sets
  * a collection that does not contain duplicates
  * has subset (containsAll), intersection (retainAll), difference (removeAll) and union (addAll) methods 
* Recursion
  * a recursive function is a function that calls itself
  * a recursive data structure is a data structure that references itself 
* Comparator - compare interface
  * allows collections to be sorted
  * compare returns an int - either negative (x < y), 0 (x == y) or positive (x > y)
* Big-O notation
  * constant, log n, n, n log n, n^2, n^3, exponential

### Quote

"Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their 
programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are 
considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root 
of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."
  -- Donald Knuth

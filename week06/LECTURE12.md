### Summary
* Arrays of Objects
* Method Overloading
  Note: Overloading and overriding are two different things. 
  Overloading is within a class, two methods with same name
  Overriding is one class inheriting from another and changing a method (equals)
* Encapsulation - combining data and methods as a single object; hide the internal
  representation of your object and only expose what is needed

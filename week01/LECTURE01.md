## 231 COSI-12B-2: Advanced Programming Techniques in Java

## Lecture 01

### Intro 
Good afternoon class! My name is Ken Brumer and I will your instructor for this course. I have a certain 
structure for the class that I like to follow which looks something like this:

  * Start with a meaningful quote
  * Go over upcoming important due dates (if applicable)
  * Review material from previous lecture (if applicable)
  * Take questions from previous material (limit to 3)
  * Go over topics for today's lecture
  * Go through the slide deck
  * Summary
  * Live coding (if applicable)

With that out of the way, let's begin. 

### Quote

```text
"There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors."
  -- unattributed but based on Phil Karlton quote
```

### Topics
* Etiquette - This is a remote class. Please mute yourself if you are not talking or asking a question. Please
  raise your hand to ask a question.
* Academic Integrity - "A student shall not submit work that is falsified or is not the result of the student's own 
  effort. Infringement of academic honesty by a student, subjects that student to serious penalties, which may 
  include failure on the assignment, failure in the course, suspension from the University or other sanctions"
